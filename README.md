# Phase1 Project

## Project Name: Movie Data Analysis for Microsoft

## Project Overview

Use exploratory data analysis to: 
1. To conduct research and analysis on the current trends in the film industry
2. To identify the types of films that are currently performing well at the box office
3. To provide actionable insights to the head of Microsoft's new movie studio based on the findings

## Deliverables

There are three deliverables for this project:

* A *non-technical presentation* 
* A *Jupyter Notebook* (https://github.com/NyarKolusi/dsc-movies-project-phase1/blob/main/student.ipynb)
* A *GitHub repository* (https://github.com/NyarKolusi/dsc-movies-project-phase1)


### Project Goal

1. To help Microsoft's new movie studio make informed decisions about the types of films they should create
2. To increase the chances of creating successful movies by understanding what types of films are currently popular
3. To position Microsoft's new movie studio as a competitive player in the film industry by creating films that appeal to     audiences and generate revenue

### Business Problem

Despite having yet t gain prior expertize in the film industry, Microsoft intends to establish a new film studio. Microsoft needs to know and understand the competitor landscape and what kinds of films are doing well at the box office in order to make run a successful movie studio. 

### The Data

The data analysed are movie datasets from:

* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)


### Research Questions
1. Which genres of movies are the most popular among audiences?
2. What is the relationship between a movie's production budget and its box office success?
3. What factors (such as budget, genre, release date, etc.) are associated with a movie's box office success?
4. How has the movie industry changed over time, in terms of budget, revenue, and other factors?
5. How do critic ratings and audience ratings differ, and which is more predictive of box office success?
6. How do movie studios perform in terms of revenue, audience and share of the top rated genres?


### Key Findings & Conclusions
1. We looked at the top genres to understand which ones Microsoft should focus on. The Drama, Comedy and Comedy/ Drama categories are the top 3.
2. We analysed the top 10 studios to understand the competitive landscape of the industry and to guide on who to be on the look out for. The main ones to keep track of are Universal Studio, Fox, BV and Sony as the top four.
3. We observed that movie production has been on the decline over the years, from 2010 to 2018



### Limitations
1. **Missing data**: There were instances where some of the data was missing or incomplete. This limited the analysis as some of the key variables were not available for analysis.

2. **Limited scope:** The analysis was limited to a specific data points like genres, which may not be representative of the entire movie industry. This limited the generalizability of the findings to other contexts.

3. **Subjectivity**: The analysis involved subjective interpretations of the data, such as the classification of movies into different genres. This subjectivity may have influenced the results and limited the objectivity of the analysis.

4. **Data processing**: The analysis involved significant data processing, which can introduce errors or inconsistencies in the data. Careful attention was paid to data cleaning and processing, but there is always the possibility of errors creeping in.

### Recommendations
1. In terms of trends on audience preference, we recommend that Microsoft should focus their production on the top 10 categories to start with.
2. We highly recommend that Microsoft keeps track of the top 10 studios, its main competitors. They can also consider forming relationships with then to collaborate and access data, analytics, trends, and new resources that can be mutually beneficial. By working together, both companies can identify new sales opportunities, promote cross-selling, coordinate marketing promotions, and strengthen their presence in the movie industry."
3. Microsoft should invest in further research to understand the reason for the decline of the movies over the years.
4. There is also need for microsoft to further analyse the impact of the the budgets allocated to the performance of the movies, and the genres that tend to get bigger budgets and how exactly movie ratings affect or influence the performance of movies in terms of grossing.
